Ashravan gasped, air rushing back into lungs that had been still for… how long? He remembered the Soulstamp, the theft, the… nothingness. Then, a searing light, a pressure, and now, this. He looked down at his hands, turning them over. They felt… real. More real than he remembered. The lines on his palms seemed deeper, the texture of his skin sharper.

He was in a small chamber, stone walls slick with moisture. A single torch flickered, casting long, dancing shadows. He remembered Shai. Where was she? He had to find her. Gratitude warred with a primal fear. What had she done? What had been taken from him? Or, more terrifyingly, what had been *added*?

He moved towards the only exit, a narrow passage leading into darkness. As he did, he felt a surge of power, a hum beneath his skin. He reached out, instinctively, and the torch flared brighter, the shadows recoiling. He could *feel* the flames, their hunger, their potential. This wasn't his Soulstamping ability. This was… something else.

He ventured into the passage, the torchlight illuminating a series of chambers, each more unsettling than the last. He found remnants of his previous life, discarded tools, half-finished projects. But interspersed with these were signs of… something else. Strange glyphs etched into the walls, resonating with the same power he felt within himself. He realized, with growing horror, that Shai hadn't just restored him. She had… enhanced him. Infused him with something ancient, something dangerous.

The passage opened into a large cavern. In the center, a pedestal stood bathed in an unnatural light. On the pedestal, a Soulstamp, pulsing with energy. He knew, instinctively, that it was the key to understanding what had happened to him. As he reached for it, a voice echoed through the cavern.

"You shouldn't touch that."

A figure emerged from the shadows, cloaked and hooded. The voice was familiar, but distorted, laced with power. Ashravan knew, with sickening certainty, that he wasn't alone in this transformation. And that whoever was standing before him was far more advanced in their understanding of this new power. A tense silence filled the cavern, the only sound the crackle of the torch and the hum of the Soulstamp. Ashravan tightened his fist, the power within him straining to be unleashed. This was it. The moment of truth. The price of being restored.
